## Operators
### The Negation ($\neg p$ )
The negation of this 
    $x=5$ would become  $\neg(x =5)$.
    It would be the same as $x \not= 5$.
You would say this as `not P` or `niet p`.

### The Implication ($p \implies d$)
This symbol implies when $p$ then $d$ ($\implies$ = therefore. 
Example: 
    Its hot $\implies$ Air-condition.
    $x$ is divisible by 20 $\implies$ $x$ is even.
For normal speak this is written as `Als p, dan d` or `uit p volgt d`

### The Equivalence ($p \iff d$)
This symbol denotes the parallel relation for an equation.
Example:
    $n^4\; is\,even \iff n$
    $x\; is \; divisible\; by \; 2 \iff x\; is\; even$ 
    I live in Nimes $\iff$ I live in France postal code 30000
This symbol is written down as `p is the equivilant of d` or 
`p als en slechts als d`
    
>[!WARNING]
> The arrow itself also displays this but $\implies$ is not the same as $\iff$. 
> Given the previous examples
> - $x\; is \; divisible\; by \; 2 \iff x\; is\; even$ 
>
is not the same as 
> - $x$ is divisible by 20 $\implies$ $x$ is even.
> 
> Because not every even number x is divisible by 20 but every even number x is divisible by 2.

## Symbols
### & (p $\land$ d)

^ is the symbol for (en, and).
p ^ d is only true when both p and d are true.

### Or (p $\lor$ D )

This symbol resembles a non exclusive (inclusive) or.
So p $\lor$ d is true when p or d is true or when both are true.

### Is Element of ( X $\in$ )
Ex: $1/5 \in \mathbb{R}$ 
1/5 is an element of the number set $\mathbb{R}$. You also have $\ni$ as the reverse.

**the negative = $\not\in$ or \\** 

### Which Holds True for ( : or | )
Ex: {x $\in \mathbb{N}$ **:** x is prime}
Where the ":" symbol is interchangeable for the "|" symbol. 

These symbols are used in a set. Take the example above this says that x is a natural number and also a prime number. 
You would read it as. *The set of all natural numbers which holds true: X is a prime number.*

### The complement $A^c$

The elements outside of A but inside another set.


### Empty set ($\emptyset, \; \varnothing$)
This symbol means there are no elements in the set.
