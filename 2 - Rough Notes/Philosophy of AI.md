# Cognitive skills needed in Turing’s Imitation game allow rational actions  

- communicating effectively helps an agent get by in a complex society  
- representing knowledge and reasoning with it enables good decision-making in a  
wide variety of situations  
- learning about how the world works enables agents to generate more efficient  
strategies for dealing with it  
# This approach sums up AI, because  

- it generalises thinking rationally, which is useful but not always necessary  
- it is scientifically easier than reproducing human thought or human behaviour  
- it equates AI with rational behaviour (clearly defined), rather than human intelligence (much harder to define)
