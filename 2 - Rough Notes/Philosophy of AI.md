# Cognitive skills needed in Turingâ€™s Imitation game allow rational actions Â 

ðŸ”· communicating effectively helps an agent get by in a complex society Â 
ðŸ”·representing knowledge and reasoning with it enables good decision-making in a Â 
wide variety of situations Â 
ðŸ”¹ learning about how the world works enables agents to generate more efficient Â 
strategies for dealing with it.
# This approach sums up AI, because
ðŸ”¹ it generalises thinking rationally, which is useful but not always necessary Â 
ðŸ”¹ it is scientifically easier than reproducing human thought or human behaviour Â 
ðŸ”¹ it equates AI with rational behaviour (clearly defined), rather than human intelligence (much harder to define)
