# Cognitive skills needed in Turing’s Imitation game allow rational actions  

‣ communicating effectively helps an agent get by in a complex society  

‣ representing knowledge and reasoning with it enables good decision-making in a  

wide variety of situations  

‣ learning about how the world works enables agents to generate more efficient  

strategies for dealing with it  

  

  

# This approach sums up AI, because  

‣ it generalises thinking rationally, which is useful but not always necessary  

‣ it is scientifically easier than reproducing human thought or human behaviour  

‣ it equates AI with rational behaviour (clearly defined), rather than human intelligence  

(much harder to define)
